Came into the hub super tired, I kinda wish I stayed home to stay sleeping. 
Meditation led by Chris, put me to sleep and it's hard to stay awake, I am yawning constantly.

We going over a quick review over what we were doing yesterday.
Im working on an about me webpage.

We have actually been working on something that is a lil bit more advanced(something we learnt on week4-5 with JAMPRS) but it was really good to see the class get into it and have fun. It was actually a bit of a learning curve for me as well, but everything started jumbling together and I forgot to close a few of the tags, phewwwwww if I did that in a review I would get a B- hahahaha

I love that the class is beginning to have fun and not feel so daunting when approaching a task like the quiz task.

I am dog tired but this has given me a bit of a pep in my step.
