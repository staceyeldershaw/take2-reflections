Came into course early.
Meditation was really good, I felt my spine relax and I began deepening my breathing, it was really nice, I almost fell back asleep.
Im going to try clean up my GitHub or possibly start a new one, as I don’t want overlap with my weekly exercises and tests we will be doing.

I have created a new GitHub account as to not confuse myself when handing in weekly tasks.
I also put a link in the cohort4 slack group, showing the website w3schools. I asked Victor if the students should use that as an activity to do after lunch break to begin familiarizing the rest of the students with basic html structure.

I have been doing a lil bit of the intro, I find it a lil boring and need to really pull my focus.

I have been doing some work on an about me practice html to make sure that I am still remembering all the learning from last year.
