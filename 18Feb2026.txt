Got into course early, not really feeling that great emotionally, still mad about what happened with my partner last night, but its a new day and I hope that I get back into the groove of things and just focus on the brightness and positivity in the hub.


The positivity in the hub has definitely carried me today, Rob led meditation today, and I really enjoyed that, I felt my arm reach out to pick the flower, I felt the bad vibes leave my body and the good vibes enter. It was just so good to be here. So I made sure to vocalize that when it was time for me to do my check in.

Doing the class work, I have completely finished the travel destination website on Japan. Began working on the week 3 exercises, but I might just do that when I get home. 
It got to 3pm and I felt the lull happen, I just don't want to work anymore, the humidity is worse than the heat if I'm completely honest.
