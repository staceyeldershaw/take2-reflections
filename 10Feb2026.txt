First day at Take 2, I'm so excited to have the routine back in my life and seeing all my old cohort the JAMPRS.

It is a bit of a finicky thing, as I have already done this I have been helping the other students, as well as checking in on the grand projects.

Ive already got everything setup so it's just a matter of waiting around for the others to catch up.
