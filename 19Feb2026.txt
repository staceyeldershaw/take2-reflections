Got in to course early, was speaking to T outside and she's a girls girls and helped me out!!!!!! Absolute legend!!!!

I am ready for my day, going to start my tracking project maybe this weekend, I do have a busy weekend so I will definitely try to carve out some time. I want to try get a jump start on this project so I'm not feeling stressed out when we only have 4 weeks to complete and hand it in.

Went through an exercise\activity called CSS Diner. It was straightforward, I had to really make sure I was looking at the question properly to use the right selectors.
It got pretty annoying near the end.
Finished it during my lunch break, had to use ai to help me a lil bit because CSS can be finicky, it was more asking for further explanation, rather than just asking for the answers.

Doing absolutely nothing, for the last couple hours, talked a lot of bull kaka outside with cohort 4. Because Ive finished everything that I needed to, I don't want to plough ahead of the class and end uo having nothing to do next week.
