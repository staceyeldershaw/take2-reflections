Got to course late, as I have to drop my daughter off at school. This will be a regular thing this week. And every other week. My dad is getting older and finding it harder to get out of bed early now.

I had a tangi over the weekend and it has made me feel like I want to attend church again, get myself and my daughter baptized. 

I am not looking forward to today as my head is a complete fog, I just had to walk down to remax (property agent) and give them an earful about missing my house inspection as I was home all day, 

I have been working through the exercises that were given, I smashed them all out while everyone was learning about css. I also have completed my fav destination webpage, it has successfully got all the requirements as posted in the week2.md file.

I am very proud of the work my cohort is doing as well. Im also going to be going to Anaru's home this afternoon to go get some well needed baby cuddles and catch up with Nicci, his amazing partner.
